                    <p>
                        I've been actively learning and building web applications <span className='text-lime-600 dark:text-lime-500 font-semibold'>since 2019</span>, starting with small personal and freelance projects while continuously improving my skills. At the <span className='text-lime-600 dark:text-lime-500 font-semibold'>end of 2022</span>, I decided to fully commit to this path by focusing on modern web technologies and working on real-world applications. Although I'm still early in my journey, Iâ€™ve contributed to open-source, joined several developer communities, and mentored fellow beginners in informal settings. I'm always eager to <span className='text-lime-600 dark:text-lime-500 font-semibold'>grow</span>, <span className='text-lime-600 dark:text-lime-500 font-semibold'>collaborate</span> with others, and be part of <span className='text-lime-600 dark:text-lime-500 font-semibold'>meaningful</span> projects that make an impact.
